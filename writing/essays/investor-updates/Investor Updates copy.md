One of the core skills every founder should master is consistency. There are a lot of books and articles written about this, which means most of us keep making avoidable mistakes.

3 mental models / frameworks worth mentioning:
- **Always get on a plane.** Always go the extra mile to meet customers, partners and investors face-to-face. In the world of endless zoom calls this is an easy way to gain advantage.
- **The importance of showing up.** Success is a matter of grind, always. In work, in sport, in love. Success in anything requires a lot of work. "Amat victoria curam" - victory loves preparation.
- Staying true to your words. Always do what you say you are going to do, in small things especially. People notice, even when they don't tell you. Reliability is one of the core qualities in a person, that goes hand in hand with success. "How you do anything is how you do everything". 

All of the above is actually crucial when it comes down to investor updates. In fact, during our most recent fundraise one of the investors who ended up writing us a check said the main reason he invested in us was how we treated investor updates: professional, data driven, consistent.
I double checked and it turns out it took us 7 months to convert this person to an investor. Mathematically every single update we sent yielded money to the company.

The way we structure our investor updates is we divide them into internal (for current investors) and external (for everyone in our pipeline, roughly 200 funds and angels).
