One of the core skills every founder should master is consistency. There are a lot of books and articles written about this, which means most of us keep making avoidable mistakes.

### 3 mental models / frameworks worth mentioning:

- **Always get on a plane.** Always go the extra mile to meet customers, partners and investors face-to-face. In the world of endless zoom calls this is an easy way to gain advantage.
- **The importance of showing up.** Success is a matter of grind, always. In work, in sport, in love. Success in anything requires a lot of work. "Amat victoria curam" - victory loves preparation.
- **Stay true to your words.** Always do what you say you are going to do, in small things especially. People notice, even when they don't tell you. Reliability is one of the core qualities in a person, that goes hand in hand with success. "How you do anything is how you do everything". 

One of HackerPulse investors told me the main reason he invested was how we treated investor updates: professional, data driven, consistent.

In HackerPulse, we divide investor updates into 

- Internal (for current investors) 
- External (for everyone in our pipeline, roughly 200 funds and angels).
