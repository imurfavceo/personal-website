      <h1>Investor Updates</h1>
      <p class="kicker compact-kicker">Published on Jan 13, 2026</p>
      <p class="kicker compact-kicker">Consistency and clarity compound into trust (and checks).</p>

      <p>One of the core skills every founder should master is consistency. There are a lot of books and articles written about this, which means most of us keep making avoidable mistakes.</p>

      <h3>3 mental models / frameworks worth mentioning:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Always get on a plane.</strong> Always go the extra mile to meet customers, partners and investors face-to-face. In the world of endless zoom calls this is an easy way to gain advantage.</li>
        <li><strong>The importance of showing up.</strong> Success is a matter of grind, always. In work, in sport, in love. Success in anything requires a lot of work. “Amat victoria curam” - victory loves preparation.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay true to your words.</strong> Always do what you say you are going to do, in small things especially. People notice, even when they don't tell you. Reliability is one of the core qualities in a person, that goes hand in hand with success. “How you do anything is how you do everything”.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>One of HackerPulse investors told me the main reason he invested was how we treated investor updates: professional, data driven, consistent.</p>

      <p>In HackerPulse, we divide investor updates into:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Internal (for current investors)</li>
        <li>External (for everyone in our pipeline, roughly 200 funds and angels).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Internal update example</h2>
      <p><em>All numbers are made up</em></p>
